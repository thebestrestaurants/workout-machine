<p>While Matt recommends most people lift weights before cardio he does recommend that endurance athletes. Cardio after your workout will make your training session feel easier because you are well rested before you engage in strength training. Even if you are trying to lose weight you can still choose to weightlifting before you do cardio. So do weights first so you have all of your stored glycogen ready to go. A general rule of thumb to keep in mind is that strength training helps to change your shape while cardio helps to change your size.
