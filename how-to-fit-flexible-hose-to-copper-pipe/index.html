<p>I found some adapters which are designed for Flexi tap to quick connectors. 15 mm x 12 nozzle hose connector. You may well be correct though - maybe this the newer way of doing it. You can then fit into each isolation valve a tap tail adapter which has a flat mating surface. Slide an adjustable hose clamp thats slightly larger than the hose over the end of the hose using your fingers. Primaflow Flexible Monobloc Tap Connector 15 X 10 X 300mm Pack Of 2 Wickes Co Uk.</p>
