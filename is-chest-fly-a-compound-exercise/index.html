<p>The dumbbell fly is a traditional bodybuilding exercise used for isolating the chest muscles promoting growth in the pecs thereby helping you to build an aesthetic physique. Chest flys are isolation if you do them correctly since there is mvmt at only the shoulder joint. The chest fly involves only rotation at the shoulder so it is a single-axis movementquote Right idea but its not necessarily rotation its just movement or joint action if you want to be technical. Its the one exercise I can feel in the moment my chest contracting like crazy. The cable crossover machine allows for a wide variety of chest exercises thanks to its ability to manipulate angles and change attachments.

<p>Compound exercise is mvmt through 2 or more joints. For example the bench press works the chest shoulders and triceps with movement at the elbow and the shoulder. Chest flys are isolation if you do them correctly since there is mvmt at only the shoulder joint. Compound exercises involve rotation around 2 or more joints. Cable exercises are great for building and strengthening your pectoralis major which is the muscle that makes up the majority of your chest. بنج بريس دمبلص أسفل للصدر والتراي Chest Workouts Best Chest Workout Bench Press.</p>
