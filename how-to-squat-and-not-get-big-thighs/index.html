Leg press The leg press gets a lot of unjustified hate from free weight elitists but the disdain doesnt change the fact that the exercise hits the thighs rather nicely. Having big butt and thighs is not just about the looks. Pin On Squat.</p>

<p>Squats increase the size of the leg muscles especially glutes quads and hamstrings by building the muscles. Bend your knees and push your bottom back and down as if you were sitting in a chair until your thighs are parallel to the floor. If you tend to have bulky thighs and want to build the size of your butt you will want to limit exercises which hit the quads and hamstrings hard. To decrease the size of the muscle you need to stop squatting and also stop other exercises that are targeting these muscles directly. By continuing squatting a person would not be able to reduce the muscle bulk and their thighs and legs would continue to grow in size. Pin On Fitness.</p>
