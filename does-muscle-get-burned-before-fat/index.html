<p>If youre short on time then Metabolic Resistance Training will be a great workout solution for you. Metabolic Resistance Training is the best workout strategy to burn fat and build lean muscle at the same time. Once that is calculated subtract 1000 calories from the total. Youll get protein from the milk and the caffeine may ease muscle. Consume no more than 25-35 grams in other meals if you must have more carbs based on your job and or lifestyle and even then make them high fiber vegetable based carbs.
