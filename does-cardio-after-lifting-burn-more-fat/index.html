Remember cardio is great for burning 200-500 calories per workout depending on what type youre doing but you cant out-exercise a bad diet. It really just depends on how much you do and how you do it. Weights should also come first if your main goal is weight loss. The answer I would give was that cardio burned more calories during the hour you were doing it usually not by a huge margin but weightlifting burned calories while you were doing it and kept on burning calories afterward to feed the muscle you just builtWeight lifting increases your metabolism because you force your body to build more muscle.

<p>While cardio will definitely burn more calories that weight training while your doing it in the long run weight lifting is also very important for weight-loss because muscle on its own burns more calories than fat. I personally prefer a HIIT workout because you can usually get the same if not better results than steady state cardio in half the time. But according to a human study done by sports scientists at the University of Tsukuba and published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise this order is also good for your cardio training as you burn more fat during the cardio part of your training. Its true that cardio exercise can burn more calories while youre working out but the benefits of weight lifting continue even after your gym session is over.
