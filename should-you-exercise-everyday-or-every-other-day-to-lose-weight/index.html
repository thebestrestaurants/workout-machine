<p>Id say it might be a benefit it youre really pushing yourself the right way. By focusing on 3-5 high intensity workouts per week you can more effectively burn fat increase your metabolism and shed pounds. That means to exercise more intensely on. When it comes to weight loss working out regularly on an elliptical machine is a solid strategy. This means more fat in your body will be burnt off in a shorter period of time when you exercise every day. Pin On Sb2k14.</p>

<p>You need to give your body to recover from damage you have done while working out. Keep on taking easy days where you exercise at low intensity until you feel fresh again. You can build a schedule that allows 1-2 days between muscle groups but puts you in the gym every day still try to take at least one full rest day. This means that if you want to train and dont have access to a gym or any facilities or equipment then you wont have to sacrifice your workouts. Scholastic collegiate or post-collegiate athletescompeting in aerobic-based sportsshould do cardio everyday. Pin On Fitness.</p>
