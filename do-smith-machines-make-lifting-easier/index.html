<h3 id="so-to-summarize-people-dont-like-smith-machines-because">So to summarize people dont like Smith machines because.</h3><p>I had to do it for several months. If you fail on a rep you can simply twist the bar so that it hooks onto one of the many pins that are found up and down the rails. If you are someone who works out alone or goes to the gym at odd hours Id suggest benching on the Smith machine for the sake of lifting heavy. For bench press squats and deadlifts specifically. Unless youve got REALLY calm seas I wouldnt even try to squat or bench.</p>
