<p>Steady-state cardio Steady-state cardio will likely burn a higher percentage of calories from fat during your workout as compared to high-intensity intervals. If you do cardio before you lift weights then lifting weights afterward will feel a lot harder and you may not be able to push yourself as much. This goes with eating too many carbs also. If you are eating far too many calories than your body burns each day then cardio at night is not going to help burn fat. That means that youre essentially going to be burning what you ate earlier that day during your cardio workout not fat. Pin On Workout.</p>

<p>Does FASTED Cardio Burn More Fat. If you lift weights for 30 minutes versus doing any other cardio activity for the same amount of time cardio will burn more calories. A cardio workout burns more calories than a weight-training workout. From resistance training to HIIT there are many methods to help you gain more muscle and quickly burn fat. This goes with eating too many carbs also. Pin On Health Fitness.</p>
