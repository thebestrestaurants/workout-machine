<p>Shoulders bigger than arms If this is your first visit be sure to check out the FAQ by clicking the link above.

If you want bigger shoulders and arms its not always about the amount of weight. Every single female bodybuilder has unnaturally large shoulders and upper pectorals. You unflexed arm should be the same size as your unflexed calf. Pin On Bodybuilding.</p>
