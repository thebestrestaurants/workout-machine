<p>With a Smith machine you can do more reps compared to barbells. Just wondering do they work equally goodi mean just to legs. I dont go heavy usually not over 225 and also do the leg press machine. Since much of the work is done getting to and from that 90-degree position it is best to be conservative and not to lower yourself further. The front squat is linked to minimal strains and discomfort. Pin On Gym.</p>
