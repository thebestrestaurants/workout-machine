<p>If you can lift with weights and have someone knowledgeable at your disposal then Id highly recommend using them. Place your hands on one bench and rest your crossed feet on the other. Target your pectorals from a different angle with a decline pushup. Once you can lift the jugs for more than 10 or 12 repetitions its time to add more water or sand to the jugs to increase their weight. Strong chest muscles can improve back muscle strength posture upper body strength and your ability to push and pull large or heavy objects. Pin On Fitness Tips.</p>

<p>Target your pectorals from a different angle with a decline pushup. Rest your feet on a weight bench box or some other sturdy object that will elevate your feet at least 12 inches off the floor. Your butt and thighs should be positioned over the gap between the benches. Once you can lift the jugs for more than 10 or 12 repetitions its time to add more water or sand to the jugs to increase their weight. To return the dumbbells to the starting position squeeze your pecs and reverse the movement.
