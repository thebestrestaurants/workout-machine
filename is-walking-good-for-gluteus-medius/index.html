Building a strong solid hip requires not only a strong gluteus medius muscle which is key in stabilizing our pelvis with weight bearing activities such as walking and running but also working on the surrounding hip musculature as this area is full of important anatomical structures. While all of the gluteal muscles are important in human movement walking the gluteus medius action has a major role in providing balance and stability when walking. Building a strong solid hip requires not only a strong gluteus medius muscle which is key in stabilizing our pelvis with weight bearing activities such as walking and running but also working on the surrounding hip musculature as this area is.

<p>Adequate strength activation and endurance of the Gluteus Medius muscle is required to allow optimization of biomechanics for walking running and for reducing further injuries. You use your glutes for pretty much everything. We must always consider however other potential causes such as an acute or chronic injury to its tendon or a disc herniation that compresses one of the nerve roots L4L5 S1 supplying the superior gluteal. Walking is only good for gluteal tendinopathy if the hips and pelvis are in the correct alignment. The affected hip region will also have pain when there is compression from lying down on that side.
