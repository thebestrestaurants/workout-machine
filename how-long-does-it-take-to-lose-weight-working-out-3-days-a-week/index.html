Most importantly of all though the routine you choose will need to be one that suits your lifestyle and therefore one that you can keep up. You will lose muscle if you stop working out. Strength training can help combat the muscle loss so people following a fat-loss program including strength training exercises may not see as rapid a change in weight.
