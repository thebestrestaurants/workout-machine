<p>Your bump may be more spread out or bigger because the muscles arent holding in the baby so well so it can look bigger with subsequent births Just because someone has a big bump it doesnt mean. I mean you cant expect your first pregnancy to be EXACTLY the same as your second pregnancy. So it can be scary when you wake up in the morning and your belly looks significantly smaller than it did before you went. If your friends bump was big enough in the 6th month of her pregnancy that does not mean your belly will also be of the same size in the 6th month of your pregnancy. The baby got so big that she actually had a condition where her pelvis started to separate early. Pin On Glute Isolation Exercises.</p>
