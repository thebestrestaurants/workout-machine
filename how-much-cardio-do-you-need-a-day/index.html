<p>Sixty minutes of cardio exercise a day can help you lose weight without feeling uneasy unlike other exercise routines like strength training. Get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. How much cardio should I do.
