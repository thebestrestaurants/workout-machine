<p>Slowly lower dumbbell back down. Dont be afraid to lift weights. For health gains at least one set of 8-12 repetitions should be performed to fatigue. If you are a beginner you should not start off with the heaviest weight you can handle. Begin with 1 or 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions and slowly progress to 3 sets or more. Pin On Exercise.</p>
