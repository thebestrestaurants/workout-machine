<p>I just bought a birthinggym ball to use in my last few weeks of pregnancy and possibly in early labour. Exercising on a birthing ball in pregnancy can help to reduce any back pain you are experiencing and make it easier for you to move around Yan et al 2014. However it is more common to use the birthing ball from 32 weeks onward when you start experiencing the effects of the growing little one from back pain and not being able to breathe comfortably. Once youve had your six-week check after childbirth and youre okay to resume your exercises it is also a great way to gently accustom your body to exercise again. When is the good time to start using the birth ball. Pin On Wedding.</p>
