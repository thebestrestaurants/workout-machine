<p>Ive been running consistently since May about 34x a week and was training for a half but now have a hip flexor strain. One site mentioned the correct saddle position for glute activation while pedaling. This is a training talk I recorded a little while back for our Bulletproof Runners Programme members discussing how to engage your glutes when running.</p>
<h3 id="ok-i-practiced-the-above-glute-activation-exercises-and-did-some-google-searches">OK I practiced the above glute activation exercises and did some google searches.</h3><p>Basically your glutes are important and needs to be the center of your running doing most work for you as oppose to your quads calves. If youre unsure what it feels like to activate your glutes simply squeeze your butt cheeks together. This movement will allow you to truly feel your glute muscles contracting as they get ready to work. The second movement is the runners pose. This exercise helps you isolate each glute ensuring that you properly engage both without favoring one over the other which happens often.</p>

Todays video jumps into precisely how to engage your glutes for running. As always being kind is more important than running so keep that in mind when commenting. Think about coming into an upright position via hip extension straightening your legs and squeezing your glutes rather than just lifting your torso up. This exercise helps you isolate each glute ensuring that you properly engage both without favoring one over the other which happens often. Pin On Fitness.</p>

<p>Resistance Band Crab Walk Drill The third drill I want to show you the crab walk drill combines the resistance elements of the bridge exercise above with the important weight bearing aspects of the hip hitch drill. Now do a few squat reps squeezing your glutes at the top of the movement. Rather than think about getting certain muscles to fire with specific exercises. Your glutes can generate a ton of pow. Perform the 2 activation exercises the glute bridge and the clam shell every single day at least once a day with the following reps and sets. Pin On Hamstrings.</p>
