<p>Yes it will go straight to your hips but it will also go everywhere else. 10ml 2 to 3 times daily before food. As you get better at lifting weights try squatting and deadlifting deeper too. Most people think that fat is directly proportioned to weight gain but thats not true. Exercise and eat well but dont get worried. Pin On Ma Vie.</p>
