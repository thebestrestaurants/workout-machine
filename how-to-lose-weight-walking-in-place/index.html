<p>Unintentional weight loss can be a sign of a more serious underlying health issue and if not managed properly can have a negative impact on overall health and wellness. Over the years I have tried a combination of healthy and unhealthy ways to look slimmer and fit into the beauty template of the society. In the Everyday Roots Book I begin the chapter on weight loss by stating that I believe there are only two ways to truly manage weight through exercising and eating healthy. So there are of course tons of other ways to lose weight in your 70s. In this article Im going to explain why its possible exactly how to make it happen and why working out is actually a surprisingly shitty way of causing weight loss.
