<p>Full-Body Workouts or Split Body Parts. Recovery time is essential to reap the most benefit from strength training. How Often Should You Train Your Back.</p>
<h3 id="training-frequency-is-one-of-the-most-hotly-debated-topics-in-the-field-of-resistance-training">Training frequency is one of the most hotly debated topics in the field of resistance training.</h3><p>Low volume high frequency works for me. Doing so will overload the muscle and you will risk injuring yourself which can set you back even more. The number of times that you should work out as well as how hard you will be working out should depend on a variety of factors. Many advocate that a training frequency of 1xweek is best whereas others favour a higher frequency approach and believe it to be superior in terms of maximizing growth. Although some studies have shown that training should be performed three four or even five times per week this study suggests that over time the differences in strength gains between low- and high-frequency training get smaller and smaller.</p>
