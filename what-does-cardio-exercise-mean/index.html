<p>When you run on a steady pace for several minutes it is cardioaerobic exercise. This is the zone where you burn the most fat and calories. With cardio you are burning more calories working harder so your body will crave more calories for energy too. Typically when we talk about cardio were referring to activities such as running cycling swimming or rowing. I mostly use weights but I always add a little cardio into my routine.
