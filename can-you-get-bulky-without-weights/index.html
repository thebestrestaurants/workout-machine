<p>By lifting weight you are creating tears in the muscles when they are repaired you become stronger and bigger. This will decrease fat and increase your muscle mass making you look leaner. So what this means is that if you stay above 12 reps per set you wont gain as much muscle mass. In fact reducing body fat and increasing muscle mass may likely lead to you getting physically smaller because muscle is more dense than fat. That depends on your diet and your genetics.
