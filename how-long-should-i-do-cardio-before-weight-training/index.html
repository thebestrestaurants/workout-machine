<p>Doing 10 minutes of low intensity cardio before lifting weight can be a good idea since it accelerates your heart rate warms your body up and generally just prepares your body for more intensive physical activity. I emphasize the phrase INTENSE weightlifting workout. We recommend doing 10-15 minutes of light cardio before lifting weights. Sometimes weight loss rather than heart health is the main goal of cardiovascular exercise. To lose fat your body needs to use stored fat as fuel for exercise.

<p>But strength first may have slight edge. Ive been doing cardio roughly for 45 mins to 1 hour. Being an fitness coach i recommend to do cardio on alternate days rather than doing on a daily basis. Weight training requires one day off for every day on so those in-between days are great days to do. Do cardio for 1520 min after your weight training.
