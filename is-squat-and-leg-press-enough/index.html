<p><strong>Is Squat And Leg Press Enough</strong>, The major difference between leg presses and squats however is that since a leg press is a stabilized machine and a squat is done with a bar that you have to stabilize as well as your entire body you are working a lot more of the auxiliary muscles such as the adductors the abductors the gracilis and so on and so forth. This includes the core glutes hamstring and back. If you can leg press heavy weights over a full range of motion you probably have healthy enough knees and hips to squat too.</p>
