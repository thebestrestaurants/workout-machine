A new study shows that obese women who followed a weight loss diet and regularly used the vibration plate machines were more successful at long-term weight loss and losing hard-to-trim belly fat. This has proven to be more effective for losing belly fat than conventional exercises. A 2009 study headed by Dirk Vissers of the University of Antwerp found that people with overweight and obesity who exercised on vibration plate machines and stuck with a healthy diet were more successful losing weight than those who dieted and exercised in more traditional exercise programs that did not include the vibration plate. To lose 1 pound of body fat you must burn and decrease your caloric intake by 3500 calories. Pin On Vintage Advertising.</p>
