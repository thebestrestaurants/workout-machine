So you conclude that your easy-ish resistance moves are building muscle in your thighs and making them bigger. Cardio has the ability to burn calories faster and thus if a wrong exercise is chosen it can result in decreasing the size of your butt.

But not so fast. Pin On The Mermaid With Muscles Guide.</p>
