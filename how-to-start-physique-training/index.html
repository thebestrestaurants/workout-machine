<p>If the classic physique is your goal youre going to want to avoid programs such as StrongLifts 55 which has a disproportionate amount of upper and lower body work. A common approach with weight training is to choose 2-3 sets of 8-15 reps. Dip 30 reps in as many sets as it takes. Add 5 reps each week. Next start lifting weights but only do six to eight reps of about 70 to 80 of your maximum effort.

Lunge pyramid descent of 12108642 each leg. And as a beginner whos taking part in a program for the first time this works well. For example when doing shoulders use one pressing movement and then one lateral raise movement. This means that the weights are light enough for you to feel the muscles working build up your skills and decrease the risk of injury. Pin On Full Body Workout.</p>
