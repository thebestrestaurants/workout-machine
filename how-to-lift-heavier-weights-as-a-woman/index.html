<p>Its going to give you a better lean muscle tone. Instead of becoming bulky women who lift weights become leaner and more defined over time with ripples and curves that make them look great in a tank top. For me I have this weird obsession with power cleans and push presses. So to totally generalize women and say theyll never gain too much muscle lifting heavy weights is not actually true. To determine how much weight you should be lifting during each phase youll need to know what your one-rep max 1RM is. Pin On Exercise And Health.</p>
