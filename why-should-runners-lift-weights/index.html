<p>I know that if Average Joe walks off the street and walks in a weight room and sees some guy at a squat rack putting up 400 poundswell that is sort of intimidating. As a quick summary heres why we recommend resistance training for every runner that we work with. Most runners have heard that lifting weights can make you slow and bulky. When we lift weights in the proper way we recruit more muscle fibres than when we run. Why strength training in generalusing dumbbells kettlebells resistance bands or even your own body weightis important for every runner. Pin On Fit Running.</p>
