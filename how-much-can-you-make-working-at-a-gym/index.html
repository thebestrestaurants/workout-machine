<p><strong>How Much Can You Make Working At A Gym</strong>, If you are planning to open a gym be prepared for an initial investment of 200000-500000. Gym trainers typically have to work a lot more hours than private personal trainers for a fraction of the salary which is why private training is often the more desirable route. If you can successfully set your own hours and build your business you can easily make personal training your career.</p>

<p>On average personal trainers in Australia earn 29 per hour. According to a report published by the American Council on Exercise ACE the average rate is approximately 25 an hour or just over 52000 annually for full-time trainers holding their ACE CPT certification. You have to work 12 hours a week for the gym doing classes cleaning all that for no wage and then pay around 100 rent a month aswell give or take a bit.</p>
<h3 id="you-could-make-as-little-as-minimal-wage-lets-hope-not-or-as-much-as-50-or-more">You could make as little as minimal wage lets hope not or as much as 50 or more.</h3><p>Work 40 hours a week and you could be earning 60000 per year helping people change their lives. That same trainer can charge 100 a session work 15 hours a week and make the same salary. Not only will it bring some of the much-needed benefits mentioned above but it can also have a knock-on effect on staff when theyre at work too. We know that is quite a range but in truth you can easily keep costs down by purchasing gently-used equipment or starting with a smaller scale facility. The contract is actually sold to a 3rd party firm for a portion of the total value the moment you sign.</p>
