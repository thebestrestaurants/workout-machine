<p>Answer 1 of 3. In conclusion a 5 day split workout can be a great choice for your workout routine whether youre looking to get into better shape or on your way to become a bodybuilder. If you split your workout so that you never reach the pump youll be working with less intensity than you should be - so be careful not to fall for it. Rather than cross fitness off your list consider scheduling in small workouts throughout the day. Working out throughout the day allows you to get shorter bursts of exercise in without feeling that you have to choose between your health and other responsibilities.
