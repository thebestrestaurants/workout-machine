But for weight loss I believe cardio is the least effective form of exercise.

<p>Others will start with a pretty decent amount. You can use weight training to lose fat and in some ways its actually better than cardio. Even in the absence of a proper Strength Training routine more of what you lose will be body fat rather than muscles just as a result of an increased protein intake. For me I like to start my caloric intake 200-300 calories below maintenance and perform 1-2 days of cardio for about 30 minutes. Most of us know that a healthy diet and exercise are the most effective way to lose weight but do weight loss supplements really work.
