<p>When you utilize only cardio for weight loss you are burning calories while you are actually doing it but you arent necessarily creating a situation where your body is going to burn more calories around the clock. Some think that weightlifting will make them bulky which isnt true and others dont think that pushing around some weight in the gym will help them lose a few pounds. But its also possible that your workouts have nothing to do with. You can even do it at home without fancy equipment. Yes strength training during a cutting phase is critical to maintaining as much lean muscle mass as you can during this lower-calorie phase. Pin On Healthy Living.</p>
