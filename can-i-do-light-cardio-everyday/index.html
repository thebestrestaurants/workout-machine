<p>1 level 1 Comment deleted by user 6y level 1 6y Yes do cardio. Youll be fine doing another day and if for some reason youre hurting tomorrow than that gives you some insight into what works for you and what doesnt. This is one of the reasons why we dont recommend doing HIIT cardio every day. It also helps you avoid plateauing. However thats not to say that you cant do cardio every day.
