<p>The bottom line. So if your goal is to get stronger increase your size or improve your power output then doing cardio before weights may hinder your progress toward those goals. A study looking at the hormonal response to doing cardio before or after weights found that in men anabolic hormones like testosterone remained elevated longer when weight lifting was done after cardio. Some of you may be in the habit of getting up early and doing cardio first thing in the morning. If your goals are building strength and mass then cardio should follow your liftingStrength and mass focused goals require ample energy and attention and going into workouts already fatigued even if its a little bit due to pre-lifting cardio can be counterproductive for these goals.

If you are short on time and need to get both your cardio and your strength training in during one workout session you may be wondering which one you should do first. If you enjoy completing cardio first then by all means go for it. If your goal is to build muscle do a cardio workout first. There is some evidence that this applies to women as well.
