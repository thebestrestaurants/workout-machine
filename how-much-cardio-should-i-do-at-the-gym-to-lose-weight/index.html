Current government guidelines say that you should do around 150 minutes of cardio per week to stay healthy mixed with some strength-based training. Some examples of a LISS workout would be walking cycling swimming jogging and elliptical work. Department of Health and Human Services recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activitythink of it as 30 minutes five days a weekfor all adults even the elderly and disabled. A low steady rate cardio workout is one where you do your exercises for no less than 20 minutes at 60 to 70 of your bodys maximal capacity. Pin On Fitness Inspiration.</p>
