<p><strong>Is It Okay To Only Do Cardio At The Gym</strong>, However I usually do a mixture of workout classes and a few bits and bobs in the gym so Im worried that switching to only running for exercise might negatively affect my fitness strength and how my body looks. One indicator of a good gym is if they offer training barbells so you dont have to start with the 44-pound standard bar and scaled difficulty options so the exercises are accessible to beginners.

There are some exercise companies coming out with masks that are supposed to allow you to work out and protect against COVID-19. Better go for HIIT as it is more efficient. Id recommend doing cardio outdoors or alone because there is a lot of heavy breathing with that.
