<p>Rise slowly to the starting position to complete one rep. Keeping your center of gravity in one place and also your knees bent move the opposite leg out to the side. Lean forward by hinging at the waist or pushing your hips back to move the kettlebell between your legs. Now lower yourself into a squat position. 273 views Answer requested by Prateek Shukla.

<p>However you wont find any exercise as complete as squats so make it your priority. Friends dont let friends skip leg day. Step back with your left foot and lower into a reverse lunge. Wear comfortable shoes that fit. Engaging your core back and glutes hinge your hips forward to lower the weights down your legs until your torso is parallel to the floor. Pin On Fitness.</p>
