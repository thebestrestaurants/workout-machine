<p>Time to figure out how long it will take me to get ripped. Estimated time to get ripped 18 weeks. Although women typically have significantly lower levels of testosterone and growth hormone they can still develop significant muscular tone and size by following an appropriate training program. Id say it took two years of hard lifting and then six months of dieting to get to a decent spot for me. 2y edited 2y. Pin On Workouts.</p>

<p>The average time it takes to get ripped 18-21 weeks 4-5 months how long does it take to go from 10 to 8 percent body fat. You dont get ripped at 13 you simply dont. I am 23 171 22 body fat 59 and just started working out and I do eat healthy. Between 012 025 pounds of muscle per week or about 05-1 pound of muscle gained per month. It takes everyone a different amount of time to see certian results. Pin On Dianabol Before After.</p>
