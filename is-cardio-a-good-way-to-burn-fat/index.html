Cardio done at a moderate intensity defined as 50-75 percent of maximal heart rate MHR appears to burn more actual fat in the moment as you sit there on the bike and watch each agonizing second go by and the calories burned number creep up but does not seem to have a greater effect on fat loss long term.
