<p>Shoulders should always be done along with Back workouts because they compliment each other and most exercises of back involve shoulders also. If you want to shock your back and shoulder muscles for one day you can train them together for once but just keep in mind that if you do so there are NO benefits of it which means youre wasting time. Youll do 3 shoulder exercises followed by 4 total arm exercises 2 for biceps and 2 for triceps. When you perform an exercise closer to the beginning of your workout it will receive more of your strength and effort than those done later so this is the most productive time during your workout. Then rest up for one or two days and hit shoulders first then chest with less intensity.
