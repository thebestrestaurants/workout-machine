<p>Lighter weights can result in muscles. Remember in order to build a significant amount of muscle you must provide your body with a calorie surplus by consistently consuming more calories than you burn each day. 10-15 reps per set increase muscular strength muscular endurance and muscle mass. If you want to get stronger without adding muscle size avoid training to failure every so often. If you adhere to eating lean non-fried sources of protein you maximize your chances of gaining maximum amounts of muscle with minimal increases in body fat.
