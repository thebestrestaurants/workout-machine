<p>My focus is on gaining muscles mass not really strength but strength has always come natural for me i know they say lift heavy for mass and i do then why are people lifting light. I have finally weighed myself on an old weight scale and realized im kind of fat. Food intake is extremely important when trying to build muscle. Maybe i increased the muscle mass on my legs but the changes in the upper body are minimal at least in a good way. In fact a 2016 study from Finland found that a combined program of strength and endurance training could lead to greater gains in muscle mass when performed in the evening rather than the morning.

<p>Im my experience it has always been very hard to eat enough to build muscle. As long as you go to failure. This will help give insight into how much you sweat during a workout. Not always but yes weight matters and I am talking about muscle weight not fat weight If a guy has more muscle weight than you then it will be difficult for you to keep him down or lift off his feet and if he has more fat weight then you are more likely to outrun him. According to the Mayo Clinic strength training can help you reduce your body fat while increasing your lean muscle.

<p>If youre building muscle but not losing weight then your body is undergoing a process commonly known as body recomposition. Im my experience it has always been very hard to eat enough to build muscle. When building muscle one needs an excess of calories. After enough training sessions youll be able to feel your back muscles working if you have been training correctly. However does it matter where those calories come from.
