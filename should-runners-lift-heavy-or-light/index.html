<p>It turns out the group who trained for intensity with 90 of their maximum lift did better both in gaining lean mass and increasing their strength than those who lifted lighter for longer. A good rule of thumb is that there should always be one high-quality repetition left in reserve. In particular doing squats to see how much weight you can handle is going to be slow lifting that. EndurElite Chief Endurance Officer Matt Mosman busts the commonly held belief that endurance athletes should only lift light weights and explains why lifting heavy weights will lead to greater improvements in running cycling OCR and other endurance sports. Specifically you shouldnt be lifting heavy more than once or twice per week and the vast majority of your training will be in the form of running. Pin On H E A L T H F I T N E S S.</p>
