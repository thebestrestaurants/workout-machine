You may want to consider a different method to connect the new piping to the existing cast iron perhaps a properly sized transition coupling. I was able to replace a section of old cast iron with ABS and connect the new ABS pipe into the female gasket on the Cast Iron side. I believe the depth of the rubber gasket was about 2 and 14 deep on the inside of the old pipe. Our cast iron piping went right under this area so I cut out a 10 foot section of pipe and installed my ABS pipe with the necessary piping for the bathroom.
