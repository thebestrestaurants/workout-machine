While the research is inconclusive some studies show the afterburn effect to be greater with cardio before weights an intense metabolic resistance training workout can create a very large afterburn effect and increase your cardiovascular health. This amount of cardio will allow for muscle maintenance and strength gains without sacrificing the benefits of strength training. This removes the need to find the time and energy to train twice a day or fit your cardio in with your weightlifting workouts. Should You Do Cardio Before Or After Weight Training Should You Perform Cardio Pre Or Post Workout Which Form Is Best Fitness Training Cardio Weight Training.</p>

<p>You can also do HIIT high-intensity interval training in place of static cardio. A University of Tokyo Study published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that doing cardio after weight training burned more fat during the first 15 minutes of the cardio session than doing cardio before lifting. In an ideal world you would do your weight training and your cardio on two separate daysor at least space them apart in the morning and evening. Doing too much cardio can deplete your muscle glycogen levels which may lead to muscle loss. Whether 2 hours is enough rest depends on the fitness and genetics of the individual.

A University of Tokyo Study published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that doing cardio after weight training burned more fat during the first 15 minutes of the cardio session than doing cardio before lifting. Experiment on one day try lifting legs before cardio and record it. Many of us however dont have that luxury so the answer to the before-or-after question depends on the type of fitness results you want. Less calorie incineration for you. Pin On Weight Loss.</p>
