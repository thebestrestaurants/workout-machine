<p>Ideally both are beneficial says Schoenfeld. If you simply want to feel and look better overall include both cardio and strength training. A cardio workout burns more calories than a weight-training. Therefore be sure to take a more conservative approach to losing weight rate of loss prioritize weight training to preserve and build muscle and strength while dieting and utilize cardio as needed to help you be in a calorie deficit helpful when you cannot eat less food due to hunger etc. I get this question often. There Is A Misconception With Cardio Vs Strength Training Excessive Cardio Can Actually Delay Yo Cardio Vs Weight Training Weights Vs Cardio Strength Training.</p>
