<h3 id="perform-the-measurement-via-2-wire-connection-4">Perform the measurement via 2-wire connection 4.</h3><p>Hi everyone I am using an HP 34401A Multimeter through RS 232 to make a 4 wire resistance measure every 1000ms very precisely. One voltmeter and one ammeter. To make a 4-wire measurement on your tester you generally need to create custom 4-wire test fixturing that combines the force and sense lines near your DUT canceling the fixturing resistance. By knowing the sheet resistance 453 reading in Ohmssquare and the resistivity 2 PI probe pin spacing reading in Ohm-cm you can calcul.
