<h3 id="dont-try-to-focus-on-fat-loss-and-building-muscle-at-the-same-time">Dont try to focus on fat loss and building muscle at the same time.</h3><p>For as long as Ive been weight training over 20 years I cant remember a time that I enjoyed doing cardio.

<p>This is when cardio can and does cause you to lose muscle. Youd have to run for hours to have a cortisol response significant enough to demand protein breakdown. I like to keep recovery time relatively high with these sprints to allow for full effort on each one. No it is not necessarily the cardio that is burning the muscle. In fact your usual cardio comes along with a fistful of pros for lifters.

<p>Dont try to focus on fat loss and building muscle at the same time. Below are the the warning signs that youre doing too much cardio. Muscle damage can come from severe rapid weight loss or muscle diseaseIf in a catabolic state not enough caloric intake to provide adequate nutriton fat can return but the muscles may sufferDont push too hard if muscle pain worsens rather than limbers. 4-10 rounds all-out effort sprints lasting 10-30 seconds is a solid protocol for fat burning cardio without sacrificing muscle. Not in the sense of a regular run or boxing session anyway. Pin On Fat Loss How To Lose Weight Fast.</p>
