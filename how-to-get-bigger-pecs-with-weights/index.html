With your chest up and a slight bend in your elbows lower the weights out to the sides until you feel a good stretch across your chest then raise them back to the start. For the novice or out of shape it will be the best starting point to getting bigger pecs without weights. I would experiment because if you open Leg day with deep squats then you might be a bit too wobbly to Dead Lift as wellinfo Ermyou were talking about how to get bigger pecs.
