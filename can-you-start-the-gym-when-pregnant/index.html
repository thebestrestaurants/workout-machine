<p>That said they should be able to advise you on suitable things to do in the gym andto take it easy i went to aquaerobics which was fun but I couldnt do all the stuff because some of it was abs based. Which time is best for walking during pregnancy. Hi ladies Im really keen to start the gym and do some form of exercise whilst Im pregnant as Im piling on the pounds and I just want my body to stay toned on my legs and bum at least. Increase this gradually to daily 30-minute sessions. Can I start running when pregnant. Pin On Sport.</p>
