<p><strong>Does Endurance Training Increase Muscle Size</strong>, None of that matters for most endurance athletes because your strength and muscle mass are both so low that almost any strength training you do will result in structural and neurological stress and therefore lead to both increased muscle mass and increased strength. By doing endurance activities that train your slow twitch muscle fibers you will be improving your muscles oxygen capacity which makes it so you can perform longer before tiring out. This increase in muscle mass is comparable to resistance exercise training over the same time period Trappe et al.</p>
