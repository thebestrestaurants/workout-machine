Youre so right most of my life on gym I was never able to put more muscle mass weight without getting fatter no matter what like without getting a fucking lard belly at 80kg now Im at 73-74kg ectomorph at 176cm height Im probably around 13 body fat right now and if I intend to cut to get to 8 I would definitely be weightening miserables 65-67kg by the end of it just like your. Theres no rule that says you have to squat 300 pounds bench press your bodyweight or even go to a gym at all. Pin On Crossfit.</p>

<p>The goal is to train so hard so often and so well that your body has no choice but to respond with a markedly increased capacity to torch fat. This is not the way to get shredded. Youre only losing a conservative amount of weight indicating that the caloric restriction is not excessive. Focus on Free Weights and Big Movements. Most training options without weights are very flexible and can be done in most places and even at home. Pin On Anavar.</p>
