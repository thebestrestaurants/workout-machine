<p>This is especially good if you are using the exercise to build on your abs which is one of the best ways to earn lean muscle and destroy excess fat on your stomach. Youve probably heard the statistics. Try these ab workouts to burn fat and get a flat belly. Changing the way you carry yourself and sit wont make stomach fat disappear but it will make you look slimmer by helping your body fat distribute properly across the torso rather than gathering at the midsection. This is when your body continues to keep burning fat well after you finish the workout. Pin On Weightloss Workouts.</p>
