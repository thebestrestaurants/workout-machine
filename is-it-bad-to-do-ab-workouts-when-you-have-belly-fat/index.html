<p>This is because to get those abs of steel you need to maintain a strenuous workout that focuses largely on your belly muscles while other muscle groups could be ignored in the process. Always work your abs at the end of your workout. You are indirectly using them for all the other exercises you do. Your body fat is like one organ located throughout your body and you cant take it off just one spot unless you have liposuction done. While this exercise will indeed cause fatigue of the abdominal muscles you might be doing them at the expense of your spinal health.

<p>Its merely a reaction to the perpetuated myth of blasting fat from your belly with these secret exercises. Thats a good thing in terms of stability for your entire body. You can do thousands of reps of toning exercises to tighten your waistline and not see fat loss. Some burning is normal because youre challenging your muscles. Planking because abs are made in the kitchen is just silly. Pin On Exercise.</p>
