<p>Staying fit during pregnancy is important for your health and there are many benefits to working your abdominal muscles during this time. Plus there is no benefit to doing crunches for pregnancy it doesnt give you back support or any of those reasons you may think. Many moms-to-be worry that certain activities may hurt their baby. The key point here is with the right modifications. You can also do it by attaching weights of 1 to 3lb on each ankle. Pin On Best Pregnancy Tips.</p>

<p>In the first trimester you can also add light weights 2 to 5lbs on each ankle. When designing a pregnancy ab workout the first thing you might want to do is ditch the full situps and opt for a modified crunch instead. It is safe to exercise your ab muscles during pregnancy. I recommend doing 2-3 sets of 8 to 12 reps. And why do you need to stop after 16 weeks of pregnancy. Pin On Whatmommydoes On Pinterest.</p>
