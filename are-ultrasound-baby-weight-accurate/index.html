<p><strong>Are Ultrasound Baby Weight Accurate</strong>, I m 37w and Dr told me my baby is at 32kg i wonder if baby weight via ultrasound is accurate coz i dont gain much weight though. Evidence suggests that the ultrasound is more accurate than using the last menstrual period for predicting when the baby is due. Which means we may over- or underestimate by more than a pound she said.</p>

<p>Im kind of skeptical about it. Did your ultrasound weight estimate come close to the birth weight. I have decided to NOT be induced unless medically necessary.</p>
<h3 id="inversely-the-closer-you-are-to-your-due-date-the-unreliable-the-measurements-will-be">Inversely the closer you are to your due date the unreliable the measurements will be.</h3><p>Although substantial research has investigated the most accurate ultrasound formula for calculating estimated fetal weight current evidence indicates significant error levels. However Im a bit concerned because at my last ultrasound they estimated that my baby weighs approximately high 9lbs. What is more accurate LMP or ultrasound. All my kids were born past their due date 8 days 9 days and 1 day respectively and their weights were 6lbs 6oz 7lbs 8oz and 6lbs 12oz. Long story short you can get the whole thing in my history on BB Im 37 weeks today and my doc is saying baby is already 8lbs 10oz and scheduled a c-section for a week before my due date.</p>

<p>That puts my mind at ease Ive heard ultrasound weights arent always very accurate. I had an ultrasound today 36 w 4 d because I was put on medication for GD. My daughter was accurate and 95lbs but it really varies greatly. All my kids were born past their due date 8 days 9 days and 1 day respectively and their weights were 6lbs 6oz 7lbs 8oz and 6lbs 12oz. At 35 weeks I had a growth scan because they knew hed be a large baby at birth. Pin Auf Adalynn.</p>
