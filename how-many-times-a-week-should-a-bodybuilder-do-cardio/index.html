<p>Take Arnold Schwarzenegger for example. Particularly during a cut. I workout about 152 hours in the morning and 45 mins on average of cardio at night 6 days a week. So for optimum results you should only perform cardio 3-4 times a week on non-resistance training days and increase the length of your cardio session by 5 minutes each week until you reach a total of 30-35 minutes per cardio session. So if you spend 90 minutes 3 times per week lifting weights 45 hours which is the amount of weight training I recommend that most beginner to intermediate trainees do for fat loss then you can get away with 270 minutes of cardio 225 hours per week.
