<p><strong>Cardiovascular Endurance Activities Examples</strong>, Cardiorespiratory endurance activities test and improve the bodys ability to sustain dynamic exercise using large muscle groups over time. The type of muscular endurance used during cardiovascular fitness activities such as running swimming or cycling is usually called cardiovascular endurance or cardiorespiratory endurance and is different from the strength training definition. Examples of activities to build strength endurance are - circuit training weight training hill running harness running Fartlek etc.</p>

The term aerobic actually means with oxygen which means that breathing controls the amount of oxygen that can make it to the muscles to help them burn fuel and move. When cardiovascular exercise is performed in water the activity is classified as no-impact because being immersed in water reduces the pull of gravity on the body. Aerobic exercise also known as endurance activities cardio or cardio-respiratory exercise is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process.
