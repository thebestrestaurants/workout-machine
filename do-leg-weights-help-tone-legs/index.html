<p>One of the most complete exercises are squats. Women tend to build more fat along their thighs making it much more difficult to meet the ideal of shapely thin legs. Try running with no more than a three-pound weight per arm or leg and no more than 10 percent of your body weight for a vest. Put on 1-pound ankle weights and sit down in front of a bench. The weight places a greater load on the muscle group being targeted. Pin On Butt Legs Thighs.</p>
