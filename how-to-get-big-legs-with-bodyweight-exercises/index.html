<p>For my money the best bodyweight exercise for strong legs is either the leg blaster exercise or the pistol squat. These are exercises for someone who hasnt been training legs at all. Also it helps if you have some kind of weights. In plain terms you are pushing more of your bodyweight with a decline push up compared to a regular push up where the center of mass is in a more favorable position. If you dont run or play sports that require running you should experience some strength in your legs quads glutes and calves.
