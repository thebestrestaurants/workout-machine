<p>If you are concentrating on building strength this allows you to work on your upper body one day then your lower body the next most days of the week. This amount of cardio will allow for muscle maintenance and strength gains without sacrificing the benefits of strength training. So whether you prefer to do cardio before or after strength youre still going to get a great workout. Or you can do your cardio in the morning and strength training later in the day. In some gyms you may also have the option of doing circuit training which allows you to work aerobic and anaerobic exercises simultaneously. Pin On Work Out.</p>
